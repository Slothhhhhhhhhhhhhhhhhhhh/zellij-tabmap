# zellij-tabmap

A [zellij](https://zellij.dev) plugin that replaces the thin one-row tab bar with a **taller, multi-row tab bar** in which every tab is drawn as a **color-coded minimap of its own pane layout** — a tiny pixel-grid thumbnail of how that tab's terminal is split. Panes are identified by color; where a tab is wide enough, a summarized title is overlaid; the `⌘N` switch hint is shown per tab. The active tab stands out — vivid fills, a focus ring on its focused pane, and an optional **perspective lift** that floats it forward.

## Preview

![renderer preview](assets/demo.png)

> The renderer rendered standalone in a terminal — five tabs of varied layouts (a single pane, a 2-column split, a 2×2 grid, a main+stack, and a 2-row split) drawn as color-coded pane minimaps. The active tab (`⌘ 3`) is **lifted forward by the perspective depth cue** while the inactive tabs recede a half-row at top and bottom; pane fills carry the **gradient sheen**, the focused pane wears its outline ring, and each tab shows its `⌘ N` switch hint. Reproduce it with the [`render_demo`](examples/render_demo.rs) example. This renderer is wired into the **live** zellij tab bar, including click-to-switch — see [Status](#status).

## Why a color half-block grid?

Box-drawing rules can only place a line on a *cell boundary*. The upper-half-block glyph `▀` paints its **foreground color on the top half of a cell and its background color on the bottom half**, so the color can change *within* a single cell. That doubles the vertical resolution (a 3-text-row block becomes a 6-pixel-tall grid) and lets even finely split layouts render as distinct color bands instead of collapsing into noise. It's the same half-block technique image-to-terminal tools (chafa, timg) use, applied to a pane map.

```text
 3 text rows        left A (full height)   right: top B / bottom C, split by ▀
   row 1   │ █ A █ │ ▀▀▀   fg=B bg=B   (top & bottom both B)
   row 2   │ █ A █ │ ▀▀▀   fg=B bg=C   (top half B / bottom half C — split mid-cell)
   row 3   │ █ A █ │ ▀▀▀   fg=C bg=C   (top & bottom both C)
```

A focused pane is marked with an outline ring and a bold label — its fill keeps the same identity hue as when unfocused, so a pane never changes color as focus moves. The ring is a luminance-shifted shade of the pane's own fill (a blue pane gets a slightly different blue outline), so the highlight stays in the pane's hue family. Titles degrade gracefully — labels that cannot fit are dropped rather than truncated into noise.

## Status

✨ **Usable today, actively developed.** Installable from a prebuilt wasm (no build step), with gradients, active-tab cues, and perspective depth all shipped.

- ✅ The minimap renderer ([`src/minimap.rs`](src/minimap.rs)) is feature-complete and unit-tested (HSL palette, half-block grid, gradient sheen, focus ring + active-tab emphasis, perspective depth, label degradation). It has **no zellij dependency**, so it runs and is tested on the native host.
- ✅ The full render pipeline is wired: every tab is projected from zellij's live `PaneManifest`, packed into column spans ([`src/line.rs`](src/line.rs)), assembled into a per-tab block at its budgeted width ([`src/tab_block.rs`](src/tab_block.rs)), and composed into the multi-row bar ([`src/paint.rs`](src/paint.rs)). By default the active tab is centered, so the strip slides to follow focus; set `align "left"` to anchor the row instead. Tabs that don't fit collapse into `← +N` / `+N →` end markers.
- ✅ Mouse click-to-switch is wired: a left click anywhere inside a tab's column span focuses that tab. The hit-test ([`src/line.rs`](src/line.rs)) maps the clicked column to the tab drawn there and converts its 0-based position to the 1-based index `switch_tab_to` expects, so it needs the `ChangeApplicationState` permission (see the first-run note below).
- ✅ The [latest release](https://github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/releases/latest) ships a prebuilt `zellij-tabmap.wasm` asset, so you can install the plugin without building it — see [Use it in zellij](#use-it-in-zellij).

The full design — architecture, rendering pipeline, degradation ladder, golden-repo mapping, risks, and test strategy — lives in [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md).

## Build from source

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1     # one time
cargo build --release               # .cargo/config.toml targets wasm32-wasip1
# artifact: target/wasm32-wasip1/release/zellij-tabmap.wasm
```

## Use it in zellij

The robust way to run it is to **install the prebuilt wasm to a local path and load it with `file:`**: a local file loads instantly (no first-launch download wait), updates cleanly, and the permission grant persists across versions. (Prefer to try it before installing? A no-install option that loads straight from the release URL is in the collapsed note at the end of this section — handy for a first look, but it does not auto-update.)

**1. Download the wasm** to a local path. Any absolute path works; `~/.config/zellij/plugins/` matches zellij's own plugin convention:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/zellij/plugins
curl -fL https://github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/releases/latest/download/zellij-tabmap.wasm -o ~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellij-tabmap.wasm
```

`-f` makes `curl` fail on an HTTP error instead of silently saving the error page as your wasm. To pin a version, swap `latest/download` for `download/vX.Y.Z`.

**2. Grant permissions once.** The bar needs `ReadApplicationState` (pane/tab layout data) and `ChangeApplicationState` (click-to-switch), but a plugin loaded from `default_tab_template` gets no usable permission prompt ([zellij#4982](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/4982) tracks this dead-end for background plugins). Load it once in a **regular pane**, where the prompt can be focused and answered (the bar stays selectable until the permission flow resolves):

```bash
zellij plugin -- file:$HOME/.config/zellij/plugins/zellij-tabmap.wasm
```

Press <kbd>y</kbd> to accept, then close the pane. The grant is keyed on the exact location string, and because the file path stays the same across versions this is a **one-time** step — a per-tag URL would need re-granting on every release. (As a fallback, add the entry by hand to `permissions.kdl` in zellij's cache directory — Linux: `~/.cache/zellij/permissions.kdl`, macOS: `~/Library/Caches/org.Zellij-Contributors.Zellij/permissions.kdl` — which is read once at server startup, so manual edits apply only in a fresh session.)

**3. Wire it into your layout.** In `default_tab_template`, give the tab-bar pane a height of 3 rows and point it at the file. KDL does not expand `~`, so use the **absolute** path:

```kdl
default_tab_template {
    pane size=3 borderless=true {                       // 3 rows (the floor); raise to 4+ to enable perspective
        plugin location="file:/Users/you/.config/zellij/plugins/zellij-tabmap.wasm" {
            shortcut_prefix "⌘"
            active_width "24"
            align "center"                              // "center" slides to keep the active tab centered; "left" anchors the row (all-fit only)
            close_button "true"                         // stamps a clickable close button on each tab; "false" to hide
            close_button_color "theme"                  // glyph color: "theme" (alert red) / "fg" (white) / "red" / "#rrggbb"
            new_tab_button "true"                       // clickable "+" after the last tab opens a new tab; "false" hides it
            scroll "tab"                                // mouse wheel: "tab" (default) switch tabs / "pane" walk panes across tabs / "off"
            tab_gap "2"                                 // cleared columns between tab blocks; "0" packs them flush
            gradient "sheen"                            // pane fill sweep: "sheen" (default) / "weave" (alternating rows) / "off" (flat)
            gradient_shape "linear"                     // sweep geometry: "linear" (default) / "radial" (circular, from each block's center)
            gradient_angle "0"                          // linear direction in degrees [0,360): 0 L→R (default), 90 top→bottom, 180 R→L, 270 bottom→top
            gradient_radial "outward"                   // radial direction: "outward" (default, base at center) / "inward" (stop at center)
            inactive_dim "true"                         // dim inactive tabs so the active one stands out; "false" to opt out
            perspective "true"                          // lift the active tab with depth (needs pane size 4+); "false" to opt out
            floating "hybrid"                           // floating panes: "hybrid" (default) overlay visible / chip hidden / "off" to hide them
            color_strategy "stable"                     // pane hue keying: "stable" (default, identity-stable) / "distinct" (spread so neighbors differ)
        }
    }
    children
    pane size=1 borderless=true { plugin location="status-bar" }
}
```

**Optional: a compact one-row title bar.** Set `compact "true"` (default `false`) and use `pane size=1` to replace the minimaps with tab titles, numbered switch hints, and a white `×` close cell. The fixed high-contrast palette uses white text on dark backgrounds; the active tab also has a leading `>`, bold text, and an underline. Clicking a tab switches to it; clicking exactly its `×` closes it. The close cell is hidden on the last remaining tab and when `close_button "false"`.

For a complete compact layout, replace the placeholder below with the absolute path used for the permission grant:

```kdl
layout {
    default_tab_template {
        pane size=1 borderless=true {
            plugin location="file:/absolute/path/to/zellij-tabmap.wasm" {
                compact "true"
                active_width "24"        // target width for every tab, clamped to 12–28 columns
                tab_gap "2"
                shortcut_prefix ""       // number-only switch hints
                close_button "true"
                scroll "tab"             // "tab", "pane", or "off", as below
            }
        }
        children
    }
    tab {
        pane
    }
}
```

Compact mode uses `active_width` for **every** tab and shrinks their width when needed. Long labels are clipped to the available columns. When tabs overflow, a contiguous window keeps the active tab visible and shows `← +N` / `+N →` counts for hidden tabs; on very narrow bars the counts are omitted to preserve room for the active tab. `tab_gap`, `shortcut_prefix`, `close_button`, and the existing `scroll` modes still apply. Minimap settings (`gutter`, `gradient*`, `floating`, `color_strategy`, `inactive_dim`), `perspective`, `align`, `close_button_color`, and `new_tab_button` do not affect compact rendering; it currently has no `+` button. The remaining option descriptions below describe the default minimap mode unless stated otherwise.

Restart the session. Because the wasm is already local, the bar paints on the **first** tab immediately — there is no first-launch download wait (a remote-URL plugin is blank until its initial download lands, which can read as a broken bar).

**4. Update** later by re-running step 1 — the download overwrites the file in place. zellij reads a local file from disk at each session start, so a **fresh session** picks up the new build automatically; a remote URL, by contrast, is cached by zellij **by URL and never re-fetched**, so updates silently never arrive. An already-running session keeps serving the old build until you start a new one — there is no in-place reload for the tab bar (`zellij action start-or-reload-plugin` opens a *stray plugin pane* instead of refreshing a layout-loaded plugin, [zellij#3927](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/3927)), so simply start a fresh session to pick up the update. (Updating a release-URL install instead? Re-warm the new URL once — see the **blank bar after a bump** note in the collapsed section below — or the bar can come up empty on that first post-upgrade session; `file:` never has this race.)

Contributors hacking on the plugin [build from source](#build-from-source) and point `file:` at their own `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/zellij-tabmap.wasm` artifact instead of the downloaded wasm.

> **`align` — center vs left.** When every tab fits, `align` decides how the row is anchored: `center` (default) re-centers the active block on each focus change, so the whole strip slides horizontally; `left` pins the row's **left edge** at the start of the tab area (column 0, or just after any reserved prefix columns), removing that whole-strip slide. Note `left` does not freeze every tab's column — the active tab is still drawn wider than the inactives, so the tabs drawn after it shift right as focus crosses them; only the leftmost tab is truly fixed. `align` governs the all-fit case **only** — when tabs overflow, the visible window always follows the active tab (with `← +N` / `+N →` markers) regardless of `align`, because the active tab must stay on screen. The default stays `center` so existing layouts render unchanged on update.
>
> **`tab_gap` — space between tabs.** Leaves the given number of cleared columns between adjacent tab blocks so the boundary between screens reads clearly (default `2`). Set `0` to pack the blocks flush.
>
> **`gradient` — per-pane fill sweep.** `sheen` (default) sweeps each pane block's fill from its base color toward a luminance-shifted shade (lighter for dark themes, darker for light ones); `weave` alternates the sweep direction on each half-block pixel row for a woven texture. The focus ring, labels, and the `⌘N` badge stay solid on top, so readability is unchanged. Set `off` for flat fills.
>
> **`gradient_shape` / `gradient_angle` / `gradient_radial` — sweep direction.** These steer the `sheen`/`weave` sweep (they have no effect when `gradient "off"`). `gradient_shape` is `linear` (default, a straight sweep) or `radial` (a circular sweep from each pane block's center). For `linear`, `gradient_angle` sets the **perceived on-screen** direction in whole degrees over `[0, 360)`: `0` left→right (the v0.5 look), `90` top→bottom, `180` right→left, `270` bottom→top, and any angle in between for a diagonal — out-of-range or non-integer values fall back to `0`. For `radial`, `gradient_radial` chooses `outward` (default, base fill at the center easing to the stop at the edge) or `inward` (the reverse). Because each half-block pixel is already ≈ square, angles read as the true on-screen angle — `45` is a real 45°, not skewed by the terminal cell's 1:2 aspect.
>
> **`inactive_dim` — visual cue for the active tab.** When `true` (default), inactive tabs are dimmed toward the terminal background so the active tab stands out clearly: its pane fills stay vivid, its shortcut badge and focused pane label are drawn in white, and no focus ring appears on other tabs. Set `false` to disable the dimming and treat all tabs with equal intensity.
>
> **`perspective` — lift the active tab with depth.** When `true` (default) **and** the bar is at least **4 rows tall**, every inactive tab recedes by one row — a half-row of terminal background inset at its top and bottom — while the active tab fills the full height, so the selected tab appears to float forward. The height comes from the layout's `pane size=N`, which the plugin can only read, not set: bump the tab-bar pane to `size=4` (or more) to see the effect. Below 4 rows the option is a no-op (every tab fills the bar), and `false` always renders every tab at full height. Pairs naturally with `inactive_dim` — color recede plus depth recede. The bar renders nothing if it is given fewer than 3 rows (the minimap needs that floor to stay legible).
>
> **`close_button` — click to close a tab.** When `true` (the default), a tab stamps a small close glyph (the Nerd Font *close-circle*, or a plain `×` where your terminal runs zellij's simplified UI without a Nerd Font) in its **top-right corner**; left-clicking exactly that cell closes the tab (via `close_tab_with_index`, which falls under the existing `ChangeApplicationState` grant — no re-grant needed). The glyph appears on the **active tab** — and, when the `perspective` depth cue is off, on **every** tab; under perspective the inactive tabs recede, where a corner glyph reads unbalanced, so they carry none. It only appears on blocks wide enough to draw a per-pane minimap, and never on the **last** remaining tab, so you can't close the bar out of existence. A click anywhere else on the block keeps its usual behavior (switch tab / focus the clicked pane), since the close target is that single cell, not the whole column. Set `false` to hide the glyph for keyboard-driven users.
>
> **`close_button_color` — close glyph color.** The color of the `close_button` glyph (default `theme`). `theme` uses zellij's own alert red — your theme's `exit_code_error` color, falling back to a built-in red when the theme leaves it unset. Some themes derive that alert color from a near-black or near-white `red` (e.g. sobrio's `red "#121212"`), which renders the `theme` glyph almost invisible; override it with `fg` (the active label's white — always legible on a colored tab), `red` (the plugin's built-in alert red, independent of the theme), or any `#rrggbb` hex (e.g. `"#ff5555"`). Affects only the close glyph and is ignored when `close_button "false"`.
>
> **`new_tab_button` — the clickable "+" affordance.** When `true` (default), a muted "+" block is drawn one gap after the last visible tab; clicking anywhere in its span opens a new tab **and** focuses it. The button is styled like an inactive tab — same width and, in a tall enough bar, the same one-row recede as `perspective` — so it reads as part of the strip rather than a control bolted on. When tabs overflow, it sits between the tabs and the trailing `+N →` marker. It rides on the already-granted `ChangeApplicationState` permission (the same one tab switching uses), so enabling it by default costs existing installs no new permission prompt on update. Set `false` to hide it and reclaim its columns for the tab strip.
>
> **`scroll` — mouse wheel navigation.** Selects what the wheel does over the bar (zellij scroll events carry no position, so the gesture is bar-wide, not tied to a specific tab). `tab` (default) switches tabs — scroll up = next, scroll down = previous, following zellij's stock tab-bar direction but **wrapping** at the ends (first ↔ last) instead of clamping. `pane` instead walks the **focused pane** forward / backward in reading order (top→bottom, then left→right), crossing tab boundaries — stepping past a tab's last pane jumps to the next tab's first pane, and back — wrapping globally; the focus is absolute, so the bar's highlight follows correctly. `off` leaves the wheel inert. **One wheel event maps to exactly one step** — there is no rate limiter (the timing-based cooldown earlier versions shipped was buggy and is gone): a stepless device (Magic Mouse, trackpad) reports a single flick as a *burst* of events and so steps several tabs / panes at once. That is the accepted trade-off; if you dislike it, set `scroll "off"` and navigate by keyboard. No extra permission is needed beyond the default set, so existing installs gain this on update without a re-grant.
>
> **`floating` — show floating panes on the bar.** Controls how a tab's floating panes appear in its minimap (default `hybrid`). Under `hybrid`, the depiction follows the tab's own floating layer: while the layer is **visible**, each float is overlaid graphically on top of the tiled minimap, mapped through the same bounding box so it sits in place without shifting the tiles; while the layer is **hidden**, each unpinned float shrinks to a small chip (`◲`) tucked into the block's bottom-right corner (a `⋯` marker stands in for any that overflow the width). **Left-clicking a chip reveals and focuses that hidden float in one step** — the way to reach a hidden floating pane straight from the bar. Clicking the `⋯` overflow marker itself reveals and focuses the first folded float, un-hiding the whole layer so the rest become individually clickable. The mouse wheel's `pane` walk (see `scroll`) steps through a tab's **visible** floats after its tiled panes, but never a hidden unpinned one — such a float is reached only via its chip, so wheeling never pops a hidden layer open (a pinned float is still on screen, so it stays in the walk). Set `off` to draw no floating panes at all (the pre-floating look). Uses only the default permission set — no re-grant on update.
>
> A float pinned with zellij's `toggle-pane-pinned` carries a small `⌖` pin marker in its top-right corner. Since a pinned float stays on the real screen even when the floating layer is hidden, the bar keeps drawing it as an overlay box instead of folding it into a `◲` chip — only unpinned floats chip. No extra permission is needed: pin state is read from zellij's session-layout dump, which rides the existing `ReadApplicationState` grant.
>
> **`color_strategy` — how pane fills pick their hue.** `stable` (default) keys a pane's color on its stable identity: the pane keeps its hue for its whole life no matter how siblings open, close, or move — but two adjacent panes whose ids land on the same palette slot then blend into one block, hiding the very split the minimap exists to show. `distinct` spreads the palette per tab so panes sharing an edge avoid one hue: each pane still prefers its identity slot and is moved to the nearest free one only when an adjacent pane already holds it, so conflict-free panes keep exactly their `stable` color and only collisions are recolored (when a pane has more edge-neighbors than the palette has hues, the unavoidable repeat takes the least-recently-used slot). The trade, and why this is opt-in: under `distinct` a pane's color can shift when its neighborhood changes. Purely a render-side choice — no extra permission, no re-grant on update.

### Keyboard pane navigation that keeps the highlight honest

zellij's `FocusNextPane` action moves the focus but **never notifies plugins** — its handler skips the session-state report ([#37](https://github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/issues/37) pins the omission in zellij's source; still present in zellij 0.45.0). With a bare `FocusNextPane` bind the bar's focus highlight freezes until some later action happens to report. (`FocusPreviousPane` reports correctly, and tab switching — `GoToNextTab` / `GoToPreviousTab` — is unaffected in both directions, so those binds need nothing.)

As a workaround, the bar accepts two pipe messages that navigate panes through a path that *does* report, so the highlight follows every step. Rebind your focus-next key to pipe at the bar instead:

```kdl
keybinds {
    normal {
        bind "Alt ]" {
            MessagePlugin {
                name "focus-next-pane"
            }
        }
        bind "Alt [" {
            MessagePlugin {
                name "focus-previous-pane"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Leave `MessagePlugin` without a plugin argument**, as above: zellij then broadcasts the message by name to every loaded plugin, and the bar picks up the two names it knows. Naming the plugin instead looks tidier but is a trap — zellij routes a named `MessagePlugin` by matching the pair *(location, configuration)* against the running instances, and the `name` child counts as configuration on the alias path, so the match fails and zellij **opens a second bar pane** instead of messaging the one you have. The same mismatch happens whenever your layout's `plugin` block carries options (`shortcut_prefix`, `scroll`, …) that the bind does not repeat verbatim.
- Each message steps the focused pane exactly like the wheel's `scroll "pane"` walk: reading order (top→bottom, then left→right), crossing tab boundaries, wrapping globally. Bind **both** directions so next and previous traverse the same order — zellij's own next/previous use a different internal order, so mixing one native bind with one piped bind would feel asymmetric.
- Works from scripts too: `zellij pipe --name focus-next-pane` does the same step.
- No extra permission — the messages ride the existing grant, so this works on update without a re-grant.
- This is a **workaround**: once zellij ships the missing report in `FocusNextPane`, a plain bind works again and this recipe can be retired ([#128](https://github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/issues/128) tracks the rollback).

<details>
<summary>Load straight from the release URL (quick try — does not auto-update)</summary>

For a first look without downloading anything, point the layout's `plugin location` directly at the release URL — zellij fetches and caches the wasm on first use:

```kdl
plugin location="https://github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/releases/latest/download/zellij-tabmap.wasm"
```

Grant this URL once before relying on the layout — the step-2 grant does **not** carry over, because zellij keys permissions on the exact location string and a `default_tab_template` plugin gets no usable prompt ([zellij#4982](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/4982)). Load the URL in a regular pane (this also pre-warms the download):

```bash
zellij plugin -- https://github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/releases/latest/download/zellij-tabmap.wasm
```

Press <kbd>y</kbd> and close the pane. Two caveats still make this unsuitable as a permanent install:

- **Updates never arrive.** zellij caches the downloaded wasm **by URL and never re-fetches it**, so the `latest` URL keeps serving whatever version you first loaded; clearing zellij's cache is the only way to move forward. (A version-pinned `releases/download/vX.Y.Z/` URL avoids the stale-cache problem but then needs a fresh permission grant on every release.)
- **Blank bar on first launch — and once again after every version bump.** An uncached URL downloads on its first session while the bar sits empty; worse, zellij broadcasts its one-shot initial tab/pane snapshot at server start, so if the download is still in flight the freshly-loaded plugin **misses that snapshot** and the bar stays blank until the *next* event (e.g. opening a second tab). A version-pinned `releases/download/vX.Y.Z/` URL is uncached again after each bump, so this recurs **once per upgrade**. Two ways out: **pre-warm** the exact URL with the `zellij plugin --` grant step above — it downloads and caches the wasm as a side effect, so the later template-loaded bar starts from a warm cache and never blanks — or, after the download lands, just **open a second tab (or restart the session) once** and it is permanent. This cannot be fixed in the plugin: while the download is in flight the wasm is not running yet (zellij paints its own placeholder, not ours), and a plugin that loads late has no side-effect-free way to *pull* the full tab/pane geometry the minimap needs — zellij-tile 0.44 only delivers it through the next pushed `TabUpdate` / `PaneUpdate`. The `file:` install above sidesteps the whole race: a local path has no download window, so the bar paints on the first tab even right after an update.

**Prefer the release URL but want painless upgrades?** [`install.sh`](install.sh) in this repo automates the two chores above for a **version-pinned** URL install. Run it from a clone:

```bash
./install.sh            # install/upgrade to the latest release
./install.sh v0.13.0    # or pin an explicit version
```

Or run it straight from GitHub without cloning (it only edits `config.kdl` and `permissions.kdl` — pipe it through `less` first if you'd rather read it):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/main/install.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/main/install.sh | bash -s -- v0.13.0   # pin a version
```

It rewrites the `tabmap location=` URL in your `config.kdl` to the target version (keeping every option intact) and writes the `ReadApplicationState` + `ChangeApplicationState` grant for that exact URL into `permissions.kdl` — so there is no un-focusable y/n prompt and no per-release re-grant. It never downloads the wasm locally (zellij still fetches it from the URL) and it verifies the release asset exists before pointing your config at it, so it can't poison the cache. Because it pins the version, the stale-`latest`-cache problem does not apply. Restart zellij (a fresh session) afterward — `permissions.kdl` is read only at server start.

If a fetch ever returns a non-wasm body (e.g. a 404 page when the release asset is not published yet), zellij caches that error text **as the wasm**, permanently — the log then shows `magic header not detected`. Recover by deleting both cache traces for that URL (a hashed blob directly under zellij's cache root, and the `https:/github.com/GeneralD/zellij-tabmap/releases/…` directory tree beneath it) and starting a fresh session.

## Development

```bash
cargo test  --lib --target "$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's/host: //p')"   # native unit tests
cargo clippy --target wasm32-wasip1 --all-features --lib            # lint (CI denies warnings)
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1                        # the loadable wasm
```

CI runs the same three on every push; tagging `vX.Y.Z` builds the wasm, generates a changelog with [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff), and attaches the artifact to a GitHub Release.
